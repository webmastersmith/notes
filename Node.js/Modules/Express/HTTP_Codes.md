[Stripe Status Codes](https://stripe.com/docs/api/errors?lang=node)
200 - OK Everything worked as expected.
400 - Bad Request The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
401 - Unauthorized No valid API key provided.
402 - Request Failed The parameters were valid but the request failed.
403 - Forbidden The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.
404 - Not Found The requested resource doesn't exist.
409 - Conflict The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).
429 - Too Many Requests Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.
500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors Something went wrong on Stripe's end. (These are rare.)
